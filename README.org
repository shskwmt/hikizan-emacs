Minimal emacs configuration.

** Set environment variables

Create a ~/.emacsenv file to set environment variables.

#+begin_src elisp
  ;;; -*- lisp-data -*-

  (setenv "EMACS_ORG_DIR" "~/org/")
#+end_src

** Usage of Emacs Agent

The `emacsagent` is a Python script that acts as a bridge between an external process and a running Emacs instance. It listens for commands, executes them as Emacs Lisp, and returns the results. It requires an Emacs server to be running and the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.

*** Running the Agent

To run the agent, execute the following command from your terminal in the project's root directory:

#+begin_src shell
python ./python/emacsagent.py
#+end_src

Once started, the agent will prompt you with `> ` where you can enter your queries or special commands.

**** Special Commands

- `exit` or `quit` :: Ends the agent session.
- `clear` :: Clears the agent's conversation history.
- `history` :: Displays the agent's conversation history.

**** Prerequisites

Before running the agent, ensure the following:

- An Emacs server is running. You can start it in Emacs by typing `M-x server-start`.
- The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set with your Google API key.
- Python dependencies are installed. Navigate to the `./python` directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.
